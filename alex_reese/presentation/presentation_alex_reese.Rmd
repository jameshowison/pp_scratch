## Resources & Communication


- learned to search inside github repos

- **not** much contact/interaction with project leaders
- by trying to "Ask questions the smart way," I did my homework first and found my answers

## Proposing artwork

- required proposal and approval
- made a mistake, had to follow up wtih PD proof

- *embarassed*!

## Management and Task conception

- benevolent dictatorship
  - coordination or control?

- structured, pre-defined tasks
  - ebook production more like crowdsourcing than peer production? 
  
- credit and incentives
